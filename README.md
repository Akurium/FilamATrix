## Motivation
I was looking at the ERCF MMU for several month now. What always kept me from starting the project were the discussions about issues and problems with  filament tip forming. Suddenly a new company showed us how they do it quite reliable. They just cut the filament. Further motivated and inspired by the design of @pure100kim who has built the [ERCF_Filament_Cutting_MOD](https://github.com/pure100kim/ERCF_Filament_Cutting_MOD) I started to build my own version of it.

## Good to know

Please be aware:

**!! THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS !!**

- This is my very first repository on GitHub. Please be paitend with me :D - Any hints are welcome!
- We will need to use one of the ADXL mounting threads
- I designed it for main body without tool head sensor as I am planning to go with [Happy Hare](https://github.com/moggieuk/ERCF-Software-V3)
- Based on the setup we will most probably not lose any build volume
- Currently the design is only available for the Dragon hotend
- As my ERCF is under construction I tested it with roughly 100 cuts by hand not seeing any wear or fatigue
- For the main body i remixed the ECAS version from [Alexanderor](https://www.printables.com/de/model/433797-clockwork-2-ecas-fitting-for-ercf)
