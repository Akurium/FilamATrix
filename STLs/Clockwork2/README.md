Print one each of:

- \[a\]\_cutting_arm_clockwork2.stl OR \[a\]\_cutting_arm_short_clockwork2.stl
- \[a\]\_knife_holder_clockwork2.stl
- \[a\]\_latch_ecas.stl
- main_body_clockwork2_dual_switch.stl (recommended) OR main_body_clockwork2_single_switch.stl

If this is a new build, or you are using a non-release version of Clockwork 2, you will also need to print these upstream Clockwork2 files, which can be obtained from the [VORON Stealthburner repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/):

- [\[a\]\_guidler_a.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_guidler_a.stl)
- [\[a\]\_guidler_a.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_guidler_b.stl)
- [\[a\]\_latch_shuttle.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_latch_shuttle.stl)
