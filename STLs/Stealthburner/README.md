You will need a set (front and rear) 'Printheads'of the modified Filamatrix hotend mounts, that are specific to your hotend.

Current supported hotends are:

- [Revo Voron](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/revo_voron)
- Phaetus Dragon [HF](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/dragon_hf), [UHF](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/dragon_uhf), [UHF mini](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/dragon_uhf_mini)
- Phaetus Rapido [HF](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/rapido_hf), [HF v2](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/rapido_hf_v2), [UHF](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/rapido_uhf), [UHF v2](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/tree/main/STLs/Stealthburner/Printheads/rapido_uhf_v2)

If this is a new build, you will also need the rest of the Stealthburner parts.

- If you have a UHF-style hotend, you will need [this updated Stealthburner shroud](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamAtrix/blob/main/STLs/Stealthburner/stealthburner_main_body_uhf.stl) if you do not have one already.

All other Stealthburner files should be obtained from the main [VORON Stealthburner repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/), including as needed:

- [stealthburner_main_body.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Stealthburner/%5Ba%5D_stealthburner_main_body.stl) - if using a regular length hotend
- [\[c\]\_stelathburner_LED_diffuser.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Stealthburner/%5Bc%5D_stealthburner_LED_diffuser.stl)
- [\[o\]\_stealthburner_LED_carrier.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Stealthburner/%5Bo%5D_stealthburner_LED_carrier.stl)
- [\[o\]\_stealthburner_LED_diffuser_mask.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Stealthburner/%5Bo%5D_stealthburner_LED_diffuser_mask.stl)
